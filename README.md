Tools and ideas related to the HAWG (Human Atlas Working Group) file format.

mrml-to-hawg: converter to turn 3D Slicer MRML files into HAWG-like files.  This converter isn't general purpose: it won't work on any MRML file.  It does work fairly dependably on SPL atlases.

tables: python scripts for creating TSV (tab separated value) file-based HAWG-like files.  `tsv-to-hawg.py` does the conversion to HAWG. `buildtsv.py` is a helper script to build TSV files from directories of data files.
